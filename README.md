# Chernoff Fish

Data-driven fish with D3 & React because humans are really bad at understanding multi-dimensional data (and I wanted to learn React, Webpack, etc). Concept from [*Visualizing Financial Data*](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-111890785X.html) by Julie Rodriguez and Piotr Kaczmarek.
